# Arcanum Dialog

An Arcanum Dialog (`.dlg`) parser written in Rust and inspired
by [Arcanum Dialogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYWEgQAh6So), a YouTube video by the one and only Timothy Cain.

Files are created inside Excel in a format demonstrated in the aforementioned video and exported as CSV. This can be
parsed directly or formatted using the `csv2dlg.py` script.
